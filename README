A gaussian elimination implementation in Python, written by me from scatch for 6.01X (the advanced programming version of 6.01, MIT's intro to EECS course). I originally looked at the Wikipedia pseudocode and tried to essentially rewrite that in Python, but that was more trouble than it was worth so I just redid it from scratch.
